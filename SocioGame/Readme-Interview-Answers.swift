1. What are the most difficult technical problems in your work experience you have encountered and how do you fix them?
 
One of the most challenging technical problems I faced involved optimizing the performance of an iOS application with complex animations and API calls,
which caused UI lag and degraded user experience. To fix this, I profiled the app using Instruments to identify bottlenecks, such as inefficient
database queries and synchronous API calls on the main thread. I resolved these issues by implementing background processing with GCD, optimizing
database queries using indexing, and caching frequently used data. For animations, I used Core Animation with lightweight assets to reduce renderin
overhead. This significantly improved app responsiveness and provided a seamless user experience.
 
2. When you’re working on a project, how do you typically approach it from start to finish?
 
 I follow a structured approach when working on a project:

 1.    Requirement Gathering: Understand the project goals and gather all functional and technical requirements.
 2.    Planning: Break down the project into manageable tasks, prioritize features, and create a timeline using tools like Jira or Trello.
 3.    Architecture Design: Choose the appropriate design pattern (e.g., MVVM for iOS) and decide on technologies and tools.
 4.    Development: Write clean, modular code with a focus on scalability and maintainability. I follow test-driven development (TDD) wherever applicable.
 5.    Testing: Conduct unit, integration, and UI tests to ensure the application works as expected.
 6.    Deployment: Release the application while setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and tests.
 7.    Feedback Loop: Monitor user feedback post-release and iterate to address issues or add enhancements.
 
 
3. How do you usually approach learning a new topic to absorb as much as possible?
 
When learning a new topic, I start by understanding the fundamentals using official documentation and beginner-friendly tutorials. I then dive deeper by
implementing small projects or coding exercises to gain hands-on experience. For example, when I learned SwiftUI, I started by building simple UI
components and gradually integrated complex features like state management and animations. I supplement this with online courses, videos, and
participation in developer forums like Stack Overflow. Lastly, I document what I learn, as teaching the topic to myself reinforces my understanding.
 
 4. “Consistency” vs “fast & efficient”. Choose one.
 
 I would choose consistency because, in the long run, consistent progress leads to more reliable and sustainable results. While being fast and efficient
 is desirable, it can sometimes compromise quality and introduce technical debt. By maintaining consistent coding practices, adhering to deadlines, and
 ensuring quality checks, I can deliver results that meet expectations and avoid rework.
 
 5. What is your immediate availability to start work if you are shortlisted for this job position?

 I am available to start immediately or within a week, depending on the onboarding process. I can prioritize any setup or initial requirements to ensure
 a smooth transition into the role.
